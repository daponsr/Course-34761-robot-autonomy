# Questions:
#  - why is the filter not update when we are not moving?
#    are there parameters which determine how oftern/when filter
#    should update the estimation?
#     there is resampel interval
#     it des not update when we are not moving because it depends 
#     on the state, and it remains constant when at the same positio
